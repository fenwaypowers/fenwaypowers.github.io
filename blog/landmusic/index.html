<h2 id="about-the-album"><div align="center"><b>About the Album</a></div></h2>
<!---<div align="center"><b>[Unfinished Post]</a></div>--->
<p>          I released my album &quot;Land Music&quot; on May 14, 2021. At the time, I was a senior at The Millbrook School, a private boarding high school in Millbrook, NY. This album was released as my CES (Culminating Experience for Seniors). So, why was it a &quot;culminating experience&quot;? To add some context, I am a drummer. Throughout my time at Millbrook, I had played in the Instrumental Ensemble, I had performed in musicals, I had performed at arts nights, spring festivals, chapel talks, and more. It was only fitting for my CES to be music-related. However, another part of &quot;Land Music&quot; is that it is also comprised of some video game music or references to video games. Video games are a huge part of my life. I love single player experiences that are fun and have engaging stories. At the same time, I also love to play multiplayer games with my friends. This is essentially why &quot;Land Music&quot; was a culminating experience for my time at High School.</p>
