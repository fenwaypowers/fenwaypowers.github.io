  Pyterm Virtual Terminal For Use With Old Serial Terminals
</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2022-12-05</strong></p>
<h2 id="preface"><div align="center"><b>Preface</a></div></h2>
<p>As of the time I'm writing this blog post, I have been elected as next semester's Junior Tech Director at the <a href="https://cif.rochester.edu/">Computer Interest Floor</a> at the University of Rochester. The club is a great place for people of all majors to interact, and one of my favorite perks of being a member is access to the lab. While at the lab, I took interest in an old serial terminal that was used to control the old sound system. Specifically, the model is the Wyse WY50. Old technology piques my interest greatly, so I made it my goal to run a modern Linux terminal on the WY50.</p>
<h2 id="research"><div align="center"><b>Research</a></div></h2>
<p>The first thing I found concerning this subject was <a href="https://youtu.be/xQTr9ZOJkC0">this YouTube video</a> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@VeronicaExplains">Veronica Explains</a>. The Video was great and explained everything very well, but the terminal used in the video was a Wyse WY55, not the Wyse WY50. An important piece of information gained from this video is that the WY55 can emulate a VT-100 terminal, but the WY50 cannot. This means that the WY50 will take some more effort to connect to Linux, since the VT-100 seems to have become somwhat of a standard or base for modern terminals.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://qmacro.org/blog/posts/2012/07/15/serial-interest-in-the-raspberry-pi/">this post</a> by <a href="https://qmacro.org/">DJ Adams</a>, I was able to learn about agetty and ncurses-term. Agetty is a much better alternative to the serial-getty systemctl service. Ncurses-term contains the proper escape codes for all of the different terminals, including the WY50.</p>

<p>You will need a null modem cable to connect to your terminal. You will also need a USB to serial adapter to connect to your computer. </p>

<p>Then, you will need to download pyterm. The repository is linked <a href="https://github.com/fenwaypowers/pyterm" target="_blank">here</a>. Alternatively, the individual <code>pyterm.py</code> file can be downloaded <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fenwaypowers/pyterm/main/pyterm.py" target="_blank">here</a> (right click the page and &quot;Save Page As...&quot;). Also, make sure you have <code>agetty</code> and <code>ncurses-term</code> (<code>sudo apt install ncurses-term</code> for Ubuntu users).</p>
<h2 id="how-to-connect"><div align="center"><b>How to Connect</a></div></h2>
<p>In your terminal, type <code>ls /dev/*USB*</code>. You should see something like <code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code> as an output. If there's no output, then your terminal is not connected to your computer. Then, type <code>agetty -L ttyUSB0 19200 wy50</code>. This will connect to the terminal using the <code>wy50</code> escape codes and <code>19200</code> as a buad rate. Make sure these are the current settings in your terminal!</p>
<p>Then once you're connected, you may notice visual glitches. Just make sure you have <code>pyterm.py</code> downloaded and enter <code>python3 pyterm.py</code>. Now you should be in the virtual terminal!</p>
